                    Pizza toppings are also packed with a compound called glutamate, which can be found in the tomatoes,
                    cheese,
                    pepperoni and sausage. When glutamate hits our tongues, it tells our brains to get excited â€” and to
                    crave
                    more of it. This compound actually causes our mouths to water in anticipation of the next bite.

                    Nowadays it seems like every chef or restaurateur is selling burgers. Bobby Flay has Bobby's Burger
                    Palace;
                    Danny Meyer has his uber-popular Shake Shack. Gabrielle Hamilton at Prune throws a little ground
                    lamb
                    into
                    her burger to make it gamier. It's served on a bun, it's easy to eat.
